customize hstshijackcaplets for bettercap

I am sharing the hstshijack caplet, which is used in the bettercap tool and is used for https-downgrade, in a way that you can change according to you.
Here, you must first download the folder and replace it with the contents of the folder in the main directory.

##Usage
git clone https://github.com/favian-jpt/hsthijack-caplet.git <br>

You replace the files in /usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/hstshijack/ with the files in the folder you downloaded.
then run Bettercap.
